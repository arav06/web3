## Introduction

To build Web3 apps we still need some knowledge of Web2

If you build a smart contract, you need to give users a way to interact with it which can only be done via Web 2 technology

## Frontend

The part of your app via which the user can interact with the app

These are client side and thus the code runs on the user's computer

For websites, its built with HTML, CSS and JS

It is the visual representation of data

## Backend

The part of your app which processes user's input and allows it to operate

These are server side and thus the code runs on the server and cannot be viewed by the user

It can interact with the server unlike frontend technologies. For example, an API (Software that allows communication between 2 different apps) can be used fetch user data stored in the database (Collection of organized data which can be easily accessed and managed)

The frontend technologies make an HTTP request to the backend server to retrieve data/store data/perform a task

Backend languages include Python, Java, Ruby, etc.
